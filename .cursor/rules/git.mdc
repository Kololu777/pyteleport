Next, carefully read the "How to write commit message" section and follow the provided example to compose your commit message. Finally, commit your summarized change using `git commit`.|
| %gb | First, run the command: `git switch -c cursor-composer-bot`, if You did't switched branch, run the command `git checkout cursor-composer-bot`  |
| %gp | First, stage the code you have written using the `git add command`. Next, follow the steps of `%gm`. Then execute `git push --set-upstream origin cursor-composer-bot`. Finally, if the current branch is `cursor-composer-bot`, delete the branch. |

## How to write commit message

Tempalte:
```git
git commit -m "<short summary>" \ 
-m "<your concise summary1>" \ 
-m ""<your concise summary1>"
```

Example:

```git
git commit -m "🐛 fix: Fix tensor dimension mismatch on inference"
```

or

```git
git commit -m "✨ feat: Initial setup for sakuramoti library" \ 
- m "- Core structure with optical flow, tracking, augmentation" \
- m "RAFT, PIPS implementations" \
- m "Testing setup, docs, dev environment"
```
